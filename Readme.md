# Fonce.Vim

A balanced colorscheme that's easy on the eyes, heavily inspired by [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim). I've tried to reduce the contrast while still having enough colors so it strikes a balance between readability and going easy on the eyes.

# Instructions

The colors of your terminal need to be configured for this theme to work correctly. Right now it supports Termite and any terminal that can take colors for Xresources.

If you are using Termite copy the contents of the file `terminal-colors/termite` into your termite config file. For `.Xresources` copy the contents of `terminal-colors/Xresources` into your corresponding file.

Install the terminal using your package manager `<Package manager> 'rishikanthc/fonce'` and set your colorscheme `colorscheme fonce`
